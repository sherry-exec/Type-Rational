Few Steps and Start Development:

1. Create a .dll file (Dynamic Link Library) by compiling the code.
2. Or, include the files in your project.

Pick Header, Link, and DLL File and start development..

For Beginners:
After the above three files created, There are two ways to use this in your programs.
1. Attach it to your IDE compile sources. (this helps using this in all programs your make) (recommended)
2. Use only in the project you want.

1.  IDE SOURCES:
    header file in include folder of your IDE.
    dll file in bin folder of your IDE.
    linker (*.a) file in lib folder of your IDE.
    
    Some IDE requires to link files to be stated explicitly, under linker options.. (e.g -file) (file should be .a           extention)
    /*this is for Code::Blocks, if someone can provide steps for beginners for other IDEs but basic procedure is same*/
    
2.  SPECIFIC PROJECT:
    header file in include folder of your project.
    dll file in the folder where your .exe will be generated. (it is usually bin\debug\)
    place linker file anywhere but your have to put its path in your project's properties (not IDE's), under linker         options.
