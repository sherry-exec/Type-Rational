# Rational Type - C++

Why I Started This Project:
May 2015, I was making my semester project, which was a command-line matrix manipulator application written in c++.
It was an advanced program which was required to manipulate linear algebra problems, i was done in a month.
I was testing my program, imagine viewing 10x10 matrix with no empty-line between rows (empty-line could take 20 lines
for matrix and only 5 left for description etc), the program maniuplate real numbers (some having 2 or 5 digits after
decimal and some pure integers) (offcourse i cannot let go a digit after decimal). I was so annoyed viewing that,
also i cannot manage proper tabs between elements and they were hardly readable.
Therefore i decided to write a very simple library for this application, using real numbers (also integers)
in fractional representation (p/q).

Challenges:
There are so many free, good and open-source libraries for managing rational numbers in c++, But i always had problem
using them, i dont know why, either because they donot provide a friendly function set or to setup them in my IDE
gives me headache.
So i came up with my own libray, which i intended to be very user-friendly plus which should be easy to setup and
start (for which i have dedicated a file ), but i also take care algorithms and performance.

Why Should One Use It:
While i was building, i got an idea hey this is able to convert real numbers (double) into fraction format (0.5 -> 1/2),
also it can parse string into a fractional number ("5/2" -> 5/2 and "4/1/2" -> 9/2), and back to both of them.
(i am not mentioning integers because they are obviously supported).
So i was wondering an object of this type can replace double and integer, so should we bother using double or interger,
because this can replace both and do with both.

Why I Open-Sourced It and Did'nt Published It:
If a person says he is smart, then surely he is'nt, similarly i cannot say that this library is complete and perfect.
(although it is complete from my perspective) BUT this is a global community and i am not the perfect here, nor i am
the best coder, thinker and solver therefore with a group of intelligent people colaborating we can make it more better
in every way.
I know the developers here are master and point out many things in this code which i want, so to learn (because it is forever)..

Some Important Functions to Motivate:
Simplification of a Fraction.   (88/24 -> 11/3)
Conversion from Double to Fraction Format.  (1.5 -> 3/2)
From String.  ("8/2" -> 4)
To String. (Encapsulating number in a string "p/q" can be useful for GUI)

Help to Make it Better and Global..
